<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my reading name is Qing. The name is taken from parts of my Chinese name. 
  The meaning of Qing isa certain musical instrument. The fullname of the musical 
  instument is Guqin. Even though my name have a nave of a musical instument, it 
  doesn't mean i'm good at playing musical instument or singing thoung. 
  In fact, i'm tone deaf.</p>

<p>I'm an avid readers of novel or various interesting stories. I can spent many, many 
  hours just to read various stories. The genre of the stories I read depend very much 
  on my mood. Sometimes, I want to read actions. Othertimes you can see me in Slice of 
  Life sections. Since it keep changing, please don't put any hope in certain genre only 
  stories.</p>

<p>If you want to ask, whether a school books or knowledges books included in the books 
  I like to read. The answers is also depend on mood. But for books contains knowledge, 
  I usually read it only when I'm interested in the knowledge, too. The knowledges interest 
  me usually is something more practical. Like how to save money, how to repair 
  something, how to make somethings, and so on. Crafting, Cooking, Knitting, DIY, Maintenance, 
  Planting and Gardening, Survival, etc. It is the example of practical knowledge I read.
  Unfortunately, this type is usually need practice to make it better. Not only reading. 
  Which I haven't do.</p>

  As for my age... it is forever 18. My country is Indonesia. I, currently, can only be 
  contacted from email. I will put a short summaries for this long paragraph later.</p>
