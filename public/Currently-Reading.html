            <li>Summary: 
                <p>Chen Xiao was a Feng Shui master before his death. He changed his fate to save his master, but died of old age.</p>

                <p>When he opened his eyes, he came to a world of immortal cultivation where there were many people who built foundations and golden elixirs everywhere.</p>
                
                <p>Chen Xiao, who had no spiritual roots and no talent, felt that he had no fate with immortal cultivation. In order to survive, he had to go back to his old job in this world of immortal cultivation without Feng Shui masters.</p>
                
                <p>Chen Xiao: “Find the meridians and acupoints, turn evil spirits into prosperity, and promote officialdom and honor. It can help your sect prosper, turn decline into prosperity, get married early, and have children. Immortal masters, don’t you want to have a shot?”</p>

            <li>Comment:
                <p>I was actually re-reading this again. but previously, I was reading MTL from the beginning to the end. Right now, I was hoping to read the fully translated versions. But, unfortunately, there is only until ch 10 translated. As most of people knows, the story with a lot on fengshui explainations, martial arts or culture things is hard to be MTL.</p>
